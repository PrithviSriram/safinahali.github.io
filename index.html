                            <h3> TEAM </h3>
                            <p>Laya Muralidharan, Felicia Alfieri, Monali Agarwal, Jacob Jorgensen, Safinah Ali. My responsibilities include user research, design, prototyping, iOS and web development.</p>

                            <h3> BACKGROUND </h3>
                            <p>This is a project sponsored by Bloomberg with the goal of improving the accessibility of the Bloomberg Terminal. For the first four months we conducted user research while at Carnegie Mellon University and narrowed down the project space. We are currently designing, prototyping and developing a solution at Bloomberg's headquarters in NYC.</p>

                            <h3> CURRENT PROTOTYPE </h3>
                            <p> Our research led us to focus on helping people who are blind hear the contents of a graph through tones. Our current prototype can be seen above. The UI is completely through touch input and audio output. As the user pans left and right a tone is played that represents how high or low the graph is at that given point. It is better heard than seen:</p>

                            <h3> RESEARCH </h3>

                            <p> We conducted research during a semester at Carnegie Mellon. It consisted of literature review, interviews with people with disabilities,interviews with Bloomberg stakeholders and an empathy study. Our timeline can be seen below:</p>

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/graph-timeline.png" alt="">

                             <h4> Literature Review </h4>

                             <p> Our team was entirely new to the field of accessibility, so we had decades of research to review. We split up accessibility over a few domains and studied the field over about a month.</p>

                             <p>We created a secondary research report for our clients, that synthesized the majority of our findings in our literature review. We wanted to go beyond dividing disabilities into the broad categories of visual, cognitive, auditory and motor. We found that there was overlap between those four categories and the solutions that exist. Instead we broke our research into conditions, limitations and solutions. An excerpt from our report can be seen below: </p>

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/graph-secondary.png" alt="">

                             <h4> Empathy Studies </h4>

                             <p> In order to gain empathy for those with disabilities and to gain a better understanding of the tools they use, we simulated a few common conditions. While empathy studies don't provide accurate insight into disability, we found it helpful to experience things from a different perspective. For example, I wore sound cancelling earplugs to simulate deafness, while using my computer for one week. I observed what I had expected - missing out on notifications. What I did not expect, however, was that I missed out on audio feedback from software such as Skype and Slack, that indicate the system state.</p>

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/graph-empathy.jpeg" alt="">

                             <h4> Interviews and Contextual Inquiry </h4>

                             <p> Although literature review helped us get an overview of the field of accessibility, our work didn't really take off until we started meeting and interviewing people. There was a huge difference between reading about something on paper, versus hearing about very real concerns someone is facing in their day to day life. We still keep in contact with many of the people we interviewed. </p>

                             <p> We were able to initially interview or conduct a contextual inquiry with 11 participants. They were split as follows:</p>

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/graph-interviews.png" alt="">

                             <p> We also had the opportunity to interview key stakeholders at Bloomberg from design, engineering, diversity & inclusion, legal, human resources and sales. </p>


                             <h4> Interview Synthesis </h4>

                             <p> Following our interviews, we took all of our notes and looked for patterns in our interview data. We grouped our findings into categories and subcategories in a large Affinity Diagram.</p>

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/graph-synthesis.jpeg" alt="">

                             <h4> Research Insights </h4>

                             <p> We synthesized all of our data from our literature review and interviews and were able to come up with seven broad insights that encompassed many of the small points we consistently found in our research (written from the perspective of our users): </p>

                             <ol>
                                <li>I invent workarounds for even basic tasks</li>
                                <li> Software updates derail my work</li>
                                <li>I am afraid of making mistakes other people might see</li>
                                <li>Even if accessibility tools exists, I can't easily find or learn to use them</li>
                                <li>I have to use multiple accessibility tools to accomplish a single task</li>
                                <li>Tools that help me also hurt my work</li>
                                <li>It's impossible for me to get the "gist" of a page</li>
                             </ol>


                             <h3> COMMUNICATING OUR FINDINGS </h3>
                             <p> In order to communicate our findings effectively, we prepared and gave a presentation for our clients. We also wrote and designed a short research findings book that our clients could not only read, but also share with others at Bloomberg. We then held a visioning session with our clients in which we had them participate in the design and brainstorming process so that they could feel invested in the ideas that we generated. </p>

                             <h3> BRAINSTORMING</h3>

                             <p> After our visioning session we brainstormed and conducted a more specific literature review in order to narrow down our focus to one of our seven insights. Eventually we narrowed our focus on our seventh insight, "It's impossible for me get the gist of a page." By doing so, we decided to create a solution that could help those with visual impairments. </p>

                             <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/graph-brainstorming.jpeg" alt="">

                             <p> After narrowing our focus on this insight, we brainstormed even further. Eventually we narrowed down to 11 concrete ideas that had the potential to help someone with a visual impairment get the gist of the GUI, content or system status. </p>

                             <h3> PROTOTYPING </h3>

                             <p> Since our focus was on people with visual impairments, many of our prototypes would have to have custom audio or text-to-speech. Because of this, many of the common prototyping tools wouldn't work or would be overkill. We started by creating mock ups for each of our 11 ideas and passed them by the UX team at Bloomberg. We then created rough prototypes for five of our ideas using Keynote, paper and audio files. we then tested our prototypes with three users that were internal to Bloomberg. <p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/graph-prototype.jpeg" alt="">

                            <p> From these tests, we were able to get a feel for what was and wasn't working. After our user tests and further discussion, we decided to focus on graph sonification. </p>

                            <h4> Interviews and Think-Alouds </h4>

                            <p> In order to understand how charts and graphs are used by those in the finance field, we conducted interviews and "think-alouds" with around 20 participants. We interviewed four graph designers/engineers and three expert users. We followed that up with ten quick think-alouds with other Bloomberg employees. We also met with people from a local blind community who walked us through the ways they currently interact with graphs. From these interviews, we were able to get a deeper understanding of how graphs were used in the Bloomberg Terminal and in general in the blind community. </p>

                            <h4> Usability Testing </h4>

                            <p> For our next round of testing, we focused on user interaction. We took some time to brainstorm how we would want the user to interact with our next prototypes. We sketched out ideas and weighed our options, which you can see here: </p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/graph-testing.png" alt="">

                            <p> After our brainstorming session, we decided on testing a few iterations and features. In these iterations, users interacted with our prototypes through keyboard commands or scrubbing back and forth through a graph via a trackpad. We sought to answer the following questions from these tests:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Which interaction gives participants the most accurate interpretation of a graph?</li>
                                <li>Which audio sounds are most pleasing?</li>
                                <li>Which audio sounds lead to the most accurate interpretations of a graph?</li>
                            </ul>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/graph-testing2.jpeg" alt="">

                            <p> For this round of user testing, I built the keyboard interaction to make an HTML web-app with sound. I programmed key patterns in the keys of the Bloomberg keyboard, where each key signified a specific value and certain keys played the stock chart patterns. I wanted to evaluate the interaction of the input medium, and learnability of the data when presented in sound. Our second prototype was built with a track-pad interaction where the user could crub across the device to listen to stock patterns. When we completed our prototypes, we were able to use the usability lab at Bloomberg to test with 6 participants (plus an additional participant for a pilot round). </p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/graph-testing3.png" alt="">

                            <p> We found out that both the interactions - keyboard and scrubbing had their advantages and disadvantages. While partcipants preferred using the keyboard interaction due to familiarity and discrete data points, they could recreate graphs more accurately using the scrubbing interface. Participants often were confused about picking up their finger or wondering when they were at the end of the graph or not. We decided to pick the best of both the prototypes and make a combination - an interaction that provides discrete discrete data points, as well as gives full user control. We decided to move from a trackpad to a smartphone touch interface. Moving from a relative positioning system (trackpad) to an absolute positioning system (touchscreen) we could overcome these shortcomings. </p>

                            <p> We also found that text-to-speech output took longer to get the gist of the graph, but it was quite accurate. By combining the strengths we saw in each iteration, we moved on to a touchscreen prototype. </p>

                            <h4> Prototype Progress </h4>

                            <p> Based on our insights from earlier prototyping sessions, we built an iOS prototype app for both iPhone and iPad. In our first two round of testing with blind participants, we learned that they prefer using the iPhone interface because they have a better sense of space on it, and find the iPad very effort-full to scrub. After 4 rounds of user testing, and iterating, we went through several interactions and gestures. We also added features, such as multi-line interactions, and panning sounds based on the feedback we received from users. Our prototype is still in progress and the current version can be seen on top of the page. </p>

                            <p>From our user research, we had learnt that users with a vision impairment are often helped by other sighted users in performing desktop tasks, especially when there are errors. For this purpose, we decided to build a visual interface to the application. This could also benefit partially sighted users and could extend our application to fully sighted users as well. Some iterations of the visual interface can be seen below.</p>

                            <h4> Evaluation </h4>
                            <p> We tested our current prototype with four blind users so far with positive results. We received constructive feedback from the users about features that were difficult to understand, and features they found very useful. One user quote that particularly stood out was: <p>  <b><i>"I haven't seen a graph in 20 years. Your product makes it seem so easy."</i></b></p> 

                            <p>We will continue iterating on our prototype and present our work to Bloomberg in late July.</p>

                            <p> <i>There are 39 million people worldwide that are estimated to be blind, and we found 7 blind stock traders. We aren't improving a product used by thousands, but we are creating an opportunity for thousands of people to use graphs. </i></p>

                            <h2>UX Design for Kindle Content Editor - Amazon</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">The project was carried out as a part of my UX Design Internship at Amazon. I worked on the User Experience and evaluation of a Kindle Content Editor tool. Details of the product are omitted due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement.</p>


                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/amazon-process-diagram.png" alt="">

                            <ul class="list-inline">
                                <li><b>Timeline:</b> May - July 2014</li>
                                <li><b>Employer:</b> Amazon.com</li>
                                <li><b>Mentor:</b> Mr. Sridhar Godavarthy, senior Software Development Engineer, amazon.com </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p> The project involved development of the User Experience of a desktop based authoring tool for creating, editing and enriching kindle content. Followed the Amazon User Centered Design methodology to deliver UX specification of the tool. Work involved Usability Evaluation, User Research, Persona building, Scenarios, User Journeys, Wireframing, and Visual Design.  </p>

                            <h3>TEAM</h3>
                            <p> The project was carried out in a multi-disciplinary team of 6 software developers, 1 operator, and 2 interaction designers. I was the interaction designer for this project. Additional members joined the team after the end of my internship.</p>

                            <h3> PROCESS </h3>
                            <p> I began by understanding the process of Kindle Content Editing. This involved attending tutorial sessions given to operators, interviewing experts, reading product specifications and interviewing the users. Amazon has a heavy focus on User Centered Design. I conducted contextual interviews, and made 4 user personas for the product. User needs and goals were evaluated. I also generated several sample use cases for the product.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/amazon-existingframework.png" alt="">
                            <p> I further made task flows of the existing products (internal and external) used for Kindle Content Editing. Based on user interview need-finding, I marked breakpoints in these task flows, where existing tools failed to meet the user needs. </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/amazon-taskflow.png" alt="">
                            <p> I ideated on new and changed product features. I presented these and went through two rounds of critique for these ideas. I further iterated features after each round. New task-flows were generated for each use case identified.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/amazon-newtaskflow.png" alt="">
                            <p> I paper-prototyped these ideas and tested them with users. I conducted think-aloud sessions with these low-fidelity prototypes and iterated on them. I created higher fidelity clickable wireframes and tested these with users. I iterated through 3 rounds of wireframes. I delivered a full UX specification document with wireframes, layouts and mock-ups.
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/amazon-wireframe.png" alt="">
                            <p> No final product screens or names are included here due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement. </p>

                            <h3> WHAT I LEARNED </h3>
                            <p> I learned the User Centered Design methodology followed at Amazon, that I find useful to refer back to in my work. I learned working directly with developers and speaking the prototyping language for seamless communication. I learned periodic work presentation for critique sessions. The biggest challenge for the project was gaining access to users for contextual interviews. </p>

                            <p> I was guided by an amazing mentor, who taught me a great deal about product based industry as well as designing desktop products. I was given a full-time employment opportunity at Amazon at the completion of my internship. </p>

                            <p> Techniche is a 3-day annual techno-management festival of IIT Guwahati that includes several competitions, workshops, tech-events, a marathon, an international school championship, an MUN, a conclave, exhibitions and social events. I began working for Techniche as a part of the design team in 2011. 1.5 years later, I was appointed the Brand Communications and Creatives Lead for the festival. I headed a team of 67 core team members, which included 12 competent designers, who I appointed, mentored and closely worked with to brand the 14th edition of Techniche.  I also handled all the social media handles and web presence of the festival. </p>

                            <p> I lead Techniche's branding and web presence, which increased immensely during the year. We observed a <b>40,000 increase in likes</b> on our Facebook page throughout the year. We were featured in several magazines and newspapers across the country. In order to gain traction and attract participation, I created a brand value for Techniche that was relevant to the target audience, as well as relevant to current events. To this purpose I designed several creatives and illustrations that gained publicity through social media. </p>

                            <p> Heading the festival has been one of my biggest learning experiences. Not only was I responsible for creating quality design, but I was also responsible for managing several individuals and bringing out the best work in them. I was extremely fortunate to work with 12 amazing designers who made the festival possible. I learned audience specific branding of an event. I learned managing social media for an event. Lastly, I learned resolving conflicts and tasking on multiple roles like publicity, event management and videography.</p>

                            <h2>Revamping the University Health Services</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">This was a 7-week project with University Health Services (UHS) at CMU. It was the core project of our HCI research methods course and was meant to walk us through the process of Contextual Design with a real client.

                            UHS approached us with a multitude of problems they were facing such as poor student inflow and lack of awareness of facilities. After research and synthesis, we identified long waiting times to be a major pain point for students and proposed a wait time estimator for streamlining the flow of students into UHS.</p>

                            <ul class="list-inline">
                                <li><b>Timeline:</b> August - October 2015</li>

                            </ul>

                            <h3> Team </h3>
                            <p> I worked in a team of 5 students from the CMU MHCI program: Jae Won Kim, Jerome Zhong, Michael Anderson, Samarth Bahuguna and Safinah Ali. We all come from a different backgrounds and areas of expertise. My responsibilities included contextual interviews, synthesis, affinity diagram, visioning, ideation and design.</p>

                            <h3> Interviews </h3>
                            <p>Since observing doctors, nurses and staff at UHS wasn’t feasible, our team of 5 conducted student interviews. Our interviewees included 6 students who had previously been to UHS and a Peer Health Advocate (PHA), which is a student position that works with UHS for organizing health education events.</p>
                            <h3>Modelling and Affinity Diagram</h3>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/responsibilities.png" alt="">
                            <p> Through team sessions after each interview, we built flow, sequence, and cultural models for each interviewee. We then consolidated the corresponding models into a single flow, sequence and cultural model representing the UHS system. Additionally, we deconstructed them into atomic pieces, and rebundled responsibilities and actions into more logical and meaningful groups.</p><p>Using interview notes, we also built an affinity diagram for an overview of problems being faced by students and UHS.</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/affinity.png" alt="">

                            <h3> Walking the Wall </h3>
                            <p> This step involved walking past these models and studying them individually and in groups of two. Design ideas, key issues and unanswered questions were put up on the models to drive subsequent design decisions. </p>

                            <h3> Visioning </h3>
                            <p> Using the issues and ideas obtained from walking the wall, we proposed visions for a better state of affairs at UHS. Furthermore, we evaluated each vision on the basis of the data collected, technological feasibility and organizational fit. <p>
                            <h3> Storyboard and Speed-dating</h3>
                            <p> The most promising concepts were sketched into storyboards. These were tested with the students we interviewed in the beginning through speed dating. Their reactions and feedback was used to further refine some of these ideas which was followed by more testing.</p>
                            <h3> Final Concept </h3>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/poster.jpg" alt="">

                            <p> After a few iterations of storyboards, we proposed a concept to address long waiting times at UHS. Our solution comprised of a wait time estimation system that would keep track of waiting times for both scheduled and walk-in appointments. The wait time estimates would be displayed both at UHS and on their website. A poster of our final design was presented to UHS administration. </p>

                            <p>The project prompt for the class was to make a fully functional gadget, that does something 'cool'. I decided to make the Drawing Robot because I wanted to practice my fabrication as well as programming skills, while building something useful. Coming from a Design background, and gaining experience in computer science, mechanizing art has always fascinated me. I wanted to make something that can draw using any medium on any flat surface. So, I had the idea of making a robot that moves on a surface on wheels and draws.</p>

                            <h3> PROTOTYPING AND FUNCTIONING </h3>
                            <p> The robot consists of two main segments, the body and the circuit. The body consists of wheels that the robot moves on, a chassis that mounts the circuit, holders for batteries, and a holder for the ball-bearing. Additionally, it consists of a level that helps lift and drop the drawing pen. The body has been fully fabricated using my personal 3D printer, that I built as a part of the class "Advanced Fabrication Techniques". The body has been put together using machine screws and glue guns.</p>

                            <p>The hardware consists of two motors that are attached to the wheels. There is an additional mini-Servo motor attached to the level that helps lift and drop the pen. Additionally there is a ball bearing on the bottom that makes the robot's motion smooth as well as help balance the weight. There are 4 AA batteries on the bottom that power the robot. </p>

                            <p> The bot has been programmed to move on a certain path. This path is the shape of the required drawing. In between the robot body is a drawing pen that the lever picks and drops to draw at different locations.</p>

                            <p> The project was presented in class and received appreciation. In the second module, I used a Japanese Brush Pen to draw, and changed the lever level to alter pen pressure. This created a calligraphic effect to the drawing with varying width. As an extension of this project, I am teaching the robot to draw with sand. </p>

                                    <p> The concept behind the chair is the egg shell cavity. I wanted to develop a sitting place in which you can get cozy into your own private shell, this ignited the idea of something exactly similar that nature has given us, an egg shell. What attracted me was the unique way in which an egg cracks open. Also, sitting in an egg always fascinated me. </p> </div>

Principles of ergonomics played a huge role in product details and ratio. The prototype served as a blueprint for the final product design. </p> </div>

                        <h3> What I learned </h3>
                        <p> This project taught me to take risks. It was a time and stamina intensive project and I ventured into a domain I had no expertise in. I learned from the artists, carpenters and fabric designers around me. I got comfortable working in a workshop. Seeing the chair evolve from a concept to a product and being used was a joyful experience. </p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">This information visualization project was carried out as a part of the elective course, Information Visualization. I designed graphics to visualise the sex ratio of urban and rural India over the years. I further made an Illustrator script to visualize a similar data from every state in the country.</p>

                             <ul class="list-inline">
                                <li><b>Timeline:</b> December 2015</li>

                            <h3> Background </h3>
                            <p> Decades of sex determination tests and female foeticide that has acquired genocide proportions are finally catching up with states in India. The decline in child sex ratio in India is evident by comparing the census figures. In 1991, the figure was 947 girls to 1000 boys. Ten years later it had fallen to 927 girls for 1000 boys. This is alarming. More than we realize. An imbalance in gender ration, can lead to severe repercussions for the society. Moreover, these figures depict a discriminatory history against females, that I felt compelled to bring to light. As a part of my elective course, Information Visualization, I chose to pick a socially relevant topic, and best use visualization to bring to light the gender divide of the country.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/gender-main.png" alt="">

                            <h3> Process </h3>
                            <p> The course taught me several information visualization techniques and which ones work well for specific kinds of data. I decided to chose a dataset with multiple dimensions, in order to learn multi-level data visualization. The data set included gender rations (number of female citizens for every 1000 male citizens) in urban and rural areas from 2005 to 2011. There was no data for the number of trans-gender citizens. </p>

                            <p> I iterated on several layouts to visualize this data. We went through several rounds of critique in the class and made improvements and increments in the iterations. Some initial iterations can be seen here: </p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/gender-iterations.jpg" alt="">

                            <p> I finally settled on a circular layout owing to the multi-level data. I wanted to depict the 'gap' which is why I used a 'part of a whole' technique, where the number of female citizens are shown as a part of the full circle of '1000' male citizens. The colors were used to show a gradient of alarm, while pointing out extremes. I also used a contrasting green for rare anomalies for data that stands out. For example, the state of Chhatisgarh has a gender ration higher than 1000. I used visual outlines of gender symbols and states for visual depiction of the concept. </p>


                            <p> I have, also further worked on creating custom illustrator scripts (only compatible with CS6) for visualizing data from any state. Contact me for access to the script. </p>

                            <h2>Spark - Ignite Your Mind</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted"> Spark is a monthly magazine by Qureeus Eduventures that brings puzzles, thought experiments, articles, activities, math-athons and games to high school children. My responsibility included completely designing the layout and visual elements of the newsletter. I also co-created the content of the magazine, and developed strategies for best presenting the content to keep make it an enjoyable learning experience.</p>

                            <p><b>Vineesh Kumar</b> (founder, business, distribution), <b>Vishesh Kumar</b> (content strategist), <b>Safinah Ali</b> (visual designer)</p>

                            <h3> PROCESS </h3>

                            <p>Spark was made with an intention of making learning fun. The idea was to include puzzles, games and brainteasers for high school children. We wished to include math and logic concepts, and teach strategy through solving these. The magazine was distributed in schools in New Delhi as a non-coursework monthly newsletter.</p>

                            <p> I was approached by the founder for Qureeus Eduventures to assist them in desiging the monthly newsletter. I worked with the team for creating content, finding/making puzzles and suggesting best ways to present these. </p>

                            <p> I worked with several iterations of layout design for the magazine. I started benchmarking with other magazines in the market (Highlight, Disney, Nat-Geo, Kids, Twinkle Star) and listed what works for them and what does not. I had the privilege of interviewing an avid high school magazine reader, and run my layouts by them. I conducted a think-aloud session with them for each iteration of the layout and made changes in the next iteration. </p>

                            <h3> WHAT I LEARNED </h3>

                            <p> I worked in a small team of 3, and learned to put on multiple hats. I helped with content as well as distribution, which were new domains for me. I learned techniques and practices of print design. I learned a great deal about learning and games through my team.</p>
 
                            <p> Two editions of Spark have been distributed in schools in New Delhi and received a positive feedback. We are in the process of creating an e-magazine and online subscription process for further editions. </p>
